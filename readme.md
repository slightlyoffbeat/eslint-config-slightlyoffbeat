# Eslint and Prettier Setup

These are my personal settings for ESLint and Prettier

This is inspired (stolen) from Wes Bos.

## Installing local / per project

```
npx install-peerdeps --save-dev https://github.com/slightlyoffbeat/eslint-config.git
```

Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project's directory (it should live where package.json does). Your `.eslintrc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": ["slightlyoffbeat"]
}
```

You can alternatively put this object in your `package.json` under the property `"eslintConfig":`. This makes one less file in your project.

You can add two scripts to your package.json to lint and/or fix:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
},
```

Now you can manually lint your code by running `npm run lint` and fix all fixable issues with `npm run lint:fix`. You probably want your editor to do this though.

## Settings

If you'd like to overwrite eslint or prettier settings, you can add the rules in your `.eslintrc` file. The [ESLint rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) go directly under `"rules"` while [prettier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) go under `"prettier/prettier"`. Note that prettier rules overwrite anything in my config (trailing comma, and single quote), so you'll need to include those as well.

```js
{
  "extends": [
    "wesbos"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": 2,
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "error",
      {
        "trailingComma": "es5",
        "singleQuote": true,
        "printWidth": 120,
        "tabWidth": 8,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## With VS Code

Once you have done one, or both, of the above installs. You probably want your editor to lint and fix for you. Here are the instructions for VS Code:

1. Install the [ESLint package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. Now we need to setup some VS Code settings via `Code/File` → `Preferences` → `Settings`. It's easier to enter these settings while editing the `settings.json` file, so click the `{}` icon in the top right corner:

```js
  // These are all my auto-save configs
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
// turn it off for JS and JSX, we will do this via eslint
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
// tell the ESLint plugin to run on save
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
// Optional BUT IMPORTANT: If you have the prettier extension enabled for other languages like CSS and HTML, turn it off for JS since we are doing it through Eslint already
"prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
```

## Troubleshooting

Start fresh. Sometimes global modules can goof you up. This will remove them all:

```
npm remove --global eslint-config-wesbos babel-eslint eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-html eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

To do the above for local, omit the `--global` flag.

Then if you are using a local install, remove your `package-lock.json` file and delete the `node_modules/` directory.
